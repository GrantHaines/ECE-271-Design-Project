# ECE 271 Design Project README

The design project for ECE 271 is a 4 week project with groups of 3 or 4 team members.  The project is fairly open ended, as your team will decide which inputs options to create drivers for the FPGA. More points are allocated for more complex input combinations.  Your team will also select which of the 7 output options to create FPGA drivers to control, with more points allocated for more options addressed.  The project requires that you at least simulate the results in ModelSim, to validate your design.  Actually implementing this on an FPGA will earn extra credit points.


## Design a FPGA Project that uses or more of the following Input options:

1.  NES Controller

2.  PS/2 Keyboard

3.  VCR Remote

4. Analog Potentiometer


## Control one or more of the following output options:

1.  Addressable RGB LEDs 

2.  DE10-Lite 7 segment displays

3.  VGA Output

4.  Audio Output (Square Wave)

5.  Audio Output (Sine Wave)

6.  DC motor (Basic Motion) 

7.  DC motor (PID Control Loop)




## Reference Links: (Links to an external site.)

 

For example:  Lets say your team design project where a PS/2 Keyboard controls a DC motor with a PID loop (PD would be fine too) that displays the current and target motor position on 7 segment displays. That project would earn your team 1 point for using a single controller and 3 points for addressing output options 2, 6, and 7.  If the project was actually built and programmed into the FPGA that would earn another 4 points.  The theoretical maximum score for this design project is a 30 / 20, or 150%.  The design project is worth 10% of the course grade.  


# Project Notes 

Use Shuman's module for NES controller - Each implement an output that can be controlled by the NES controller 

Meeting Saturday November 23 in the Afternoon.
- This meeting we need to solidify plan for the couple weeks after (We wil not meet the week of thanksgiving)
-Ben will work on implementing 4. Audio Output (Square Wave)
